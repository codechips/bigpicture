# bigpicture

Simple golang program to scrape images from Boston Globe's Big Picture.

## Why?

Because I think they are nice and I wanted to use them as my screen saver.

## How?
```shell

$ go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery
$ go build
$ ./bigpicture

```
## Runtime opts

You can specify _-d="some/dowload/folder"_ flag if you want you pictures downloaded somewhere else than _$HOME/pictures/bigpicture_.
